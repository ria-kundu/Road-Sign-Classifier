# Road-Sign-Classifier

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection
In this project, I used the python Keras library to implement a CNN to detect four classes of road signs with 75% accuracy. 

I leverage tools like BeautifulSoup to extract metadata from the image files in order to prepare my dataset. Throughout the process I tuned my model, changing aspects like the number of layers, the kernel size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
